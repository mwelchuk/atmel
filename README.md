Libraries and test code written for Atmel microcontrollers.

The code is organised based on the microcontroller for which the code was
written. Common code is symbolically linked from the "libraries" directory
under each microcontroller. The atmega328p is the microcontroller found on
some of the Arduino family of boards. This code is written primarily for use
with AVR GCC rather than the Arduino coding environment.
